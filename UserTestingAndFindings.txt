Does the app look like it is supposed to?
No. The color of the building is white and does not reflect what the Unity editor is showing.

Does the app feel like room scale?
No. It feels as though I am smaller than what I usually feel in the real world.

Does the lighting work?
No. None of the lighting is working as expected.

How is the atmosphere?
Preety blank since the inside of the building is white with a few floating blue orbs.

Findings:

I find that the program needs to be worked on until the app on my phone reflects the app on the
Unity editor.Also I have to scale down the building.
